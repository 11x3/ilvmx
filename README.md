# Internet Land of #virtual Magic and #excitement.

ILvMx is a functionally minded cloud app server, or something close to an internet load virtual module exchange. Written with Elixir-lang and `Vagrant` so of course ILvMx is easily cloud or self-hostable. The working-level API currently supports native Elixir, and HTTP APIs, with Elm-lang and other support coming.

## Features

- Storage + Code - global hashtag-based namespace of storage + code.
- Reactive - completely async event, time, and frame-based execution.
- Fun(ctional) - fun and functional/reactive.
- Fast - low overhead `Bots` and default static object graphs.
- Open Source - server/apps/dsl are completely open source.

3. Clone repo `git clone git://github.com/lolnub/ilvmx.git`
4. Back to vagrant and our ilvmx server should `vagrant up && vagrant ssh`
5. `guest$ cd /ilvmx && iex -S mix
