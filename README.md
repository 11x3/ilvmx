# Internet Land of #virtual Magic and #excitement.

ILvMx is a functionally minded cloud app server, or something close to an internet load virtual module exchange. Written with Elixir-lang and `Vagrant` so of course ILvMx is easily cloud or self-hostable. The working-level API currently supports native Elixir, and HTTP APIs, with Elm-lang and other support coming.

## Features

- Storage + Code - global hashtag-based namespace of storage + code
- Reactive - completely async event, time, and frame-based execution
- Fun(ctional) - function-level partitioning
- Fast - low overhead `Bots` and default static object graphs
- Open Source - server/apps/dsl are completely open source

Description of a reactive and functional development style for cloud apps.

ATE stands for Adapt > Transform > Emit

ATE is an attempt to document a reactive functional development style where data is always pushed forward and each stage or module only has a single concern that it alone handles. 

Do your job here, push forward â€“ never look back.

1. Adapt: protocol-specific adapters create abstract work requests 
2. Transform: core app executes actor models and updates data
3. Emit: generate objects and events to the outside world

## General

- Elixir + Ember
